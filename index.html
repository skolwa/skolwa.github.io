                	 Hi! My name is Sthabile. I am a radio astronomer whose main research interests center around two overarching topics (i) active galactic nuclei (AGN) and (ii) source populations selected by deep extragalactic radio surveys. Currently, I am carrying out much of this research as a member of the MeerKAT Large Survey Project working group <a href="https://www.mighteesurvey.org/">MIGHTEE</a>, superMIGHTEE (MIGHTEE + commensal <a href="http://www.gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in/doc/ugmrt.pdf">uGMRT</a> observations), and <a href="https://lofar-uk.org/">LOFAR</a> collaborations. I am also involved in efforts to develop anomaly detection software pipelines for the <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">Vera C. Rubin Observatory / LSST.</a> 
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    <br>
         			<strong><h3>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)</h3></strong>
         			<ul>
         				<strong><li>Observational constraints on AGN feedback</li></strong>
                        The tightly constrained black-hole and bulge mass (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ARA%26A..51..511K/abstract">KH13</a>) and black-hole mass velocity dispersion (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...698..198G/abstract">G09</a>) relations in astrophysics demonstrate the inextricable link between the evolution of supermassive black-holes and their host galaxies. In studying the intricate ways in which active galactic nuclei (AGN), through jets and radiative winds, impact star-formation, we are capable of developing a deeper understanding of how black-holes co-evolve with their galaxies.<br>
                        <br>
                        In an effort to understand how kinetic or mechanical feedback operates within galaxies hosting radio-loud active galactic nuclei, my collaborators and I examined optical integral field unit (IFU) datacubes from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) UT4 instrument, <a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/instruments/muse.html">MUSE</a>, as well as mm/sub-mm data from <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/unitedkingdom/teles-instr/alma/">ALMA</a> for a handful of radio galaxies. <br>
                        <br> 
                        Of this sample, we selected the radio galaxy MRC 0943-242 for single-source study on the extended emission nebular region. This work was published in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...625A.102K/abstract">Kolwa et al. 2019b.</a> where we provide evidence for jet-gas interactions in HeII 1640&#8491; emission lines (shown below) based on the VLT/MUSE observations. Additionally, we trace the cool, ionised gas component (T~10,000 K) within the extended halo of a high-power radio-AGN host galaxy at z=2.9. <br>
                        <br>

                        The VLT/MUSE observations also provide evidence of a large-scale (<60 kpc wide) expanding shell of metal-enriched and ionised gas which results the observed absorption lines superimposed on the Lyman-&#945;, CIV and NV (shown below) emission profiles detected across the projected scale of the extended Lyman-&#945; nebulae surrounding this galaxy. <br>

                        <strong><li>The impact of large-scale (Mpc) structure on AGN activity</li></strong>
                        While it is commonly accepted that AGN have a significant impact on the host galaxy's stars, dust and gas, the role of environment on AGN triggering is rather contentious. Results are biased by the wavelength-selectin of AGN and the distance-scale on which environment density is measured. My latest interest is in studying the influence of cosmological Mpc-scale structures on occurrence and recurrence of AGN. <br>
                        <br> 
                        In the past, I studied the kpc-scale environments of radio-AGN. In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.482.5156K/abstract">Kolwa et al. 2019a,</a> we obtained a sample of VLA-detected radio sources in the <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/stripe82/en/">SDSS Stripe 82</a> field and found significant and consistent over-densities within galaxy group scale environments of nearby radio-AGN z < 0.8. In agreement with the majority of findings on radio-AGN, we found that the kpc-scale environments of radio-AGN host galaxies are over-dense relative to non-AGN (or inactive galaxies) and radio-power is not strongly correlated with environment over kpc<sup>3</sup> volumes, in the nearby Universe.<br>

         			<strong><h3>Radio Source Populations</h3></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <strong><li>The evolution of radio-AGN and star-forming galaxies</li></strong>
                        In deep extragalactic radio continuum surveys, we can select wide samples radio-active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxy populations. Combining these sensitive radio detections with infrared, optical and X-ray detections, we can trace emission from the stars, dust, gas and central black-hole of galaxy. With such multiwavelength datasets, we place observational constraints on the relations between physical components within the host galaxies in hopes of understanding how the galaxies have evolved.<br> 
                        <br> 
                        In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.525.5831K/abstract">Kolwa et al. (2023)</a>, we obtain constraints and upper limits on molecular gas mass from neutral carbon line emission in seven high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs). These detections allowed us to determine their gas fractions and star-forming efficiencies (seen below).  <br>

                        <br> 
                       <strong><li>Quantifying systematic bias and selection-effects</li></strong>
                        Radio continuum detections are incredibly useful in providing dust-unbiased observations of galaxies. However, problems such as incompleteness and blending do arise when we cross-identify radio-detected sources with multi-wavelength (optical, infrared and X-ray) catalogues. Incompleteness and blending in multi-wavelength cross-identification can lead to biases in observed scaling relations, luminosity and mass distributions of radio-selected sources. One focal point of my research is the development of new and innovative ways to quantify, predict and correct the impact of instrument-related and observational biases. <br> 
                        <br> 
                        In current work, we study spectral curvature of the faint microJansky radio source population selected by MeerKAT/MIGHTEE L-band and uGMRT (superMIGHTEE) surveys which span observing frequencies of approximately 100 - 1800 MHz. We do so with the purpose of determining the physical mechanisms underlying radio emission in these sources (mainly radio-AGN and star-forming galaxies). Owed to the fact that our radio source sample is incomplete, relations such as the radio colour-colour plot (seen below) are systematically biased towards specific spectral shapes. In this case, predicting the unbiased distribution via simulations of radio source populations is crucial. <br>
